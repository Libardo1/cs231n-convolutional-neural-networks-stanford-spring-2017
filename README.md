# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This repository is the collection of solutions to the problem sets in Stanford
University's CS231n course from Spring 2017. The `assignments` directory of the
source tree includes the original bare problem sets. The `src` directory contains my solutions. The `datasets` directory contains compressed archives of the data sets used in the problem sets.

### Notes
* Andrej Karpathy's lecture from the course can be found (here)[https://cs231n.github.io].
* The original course website is (here)[https://cs231n.stanford.edu/].
* I keep an archive of the accompanying lecture notes (here)[https://github.com/stallmanifold/cs231n.github.io/].
